This marked the commencement of a sequence of web stack debugging projects. Within these assignments, I was presented with malfunctioning or buggy web stacks confined within isolated containers. My responsibility involved rectifying these web stacks to restore their functionality. In pursuit of this goal, I meticulously crafted scripts to automate the execution of the required commands for mending each web stack.
